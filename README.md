# mtMacroDevUtils (`lib:mf.dev.utils`)

An addon library for MapTool containing various general-purpose macros.

> **NOTE:** This project is currently in very early development stages!
> Everything is 100% guaranteed to change and/or break in the near future.

**Some General Plans:**

- Add intuitive abstractions for complex macro capabilities.
- Provide "shortcuts" for some common macro techniques.
- Establish some standardization that can help disparate libraries to be compatible with each other.


**Broader goals:**

- Foster a more modular and interoperable approach to macro development in the MapTool community.
- Be engaged with MapTool's ongoing development of the Add-on Libraries feature.
- Embrace the functional nature of MapTool macro development.
- Write code that is easy to share, use, *and* modify.


## Documentation

Documentation for the project will have a minimalistic approach that will
emphasize viewing the source on GitHub. Most documentation will exist in
`README.md` files alongside the source code, which GitHub will render
when navigating between folders in the repository. Any sort of modification-
related information and options will be documented in comments within the
source. These practices are intended to keep all documentation with the
library itself.
